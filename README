README - RT-SLAM ROS node
-------------------------

"Quick"start

1) Install robotpkg (See http://robotpkg.openrobots.org)
2) Clone robotpkg wip (See http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg-wip.html)
3) Install RT-SLAM
      $ cd $ROBOTPKG_BASE/src/robotpkg/wip/jafar-rtslam/
      $ make update
4) Install ROS (See ros.org)
5) Setup the catkin workspace (See ROS Tutorials)
6) Put rtslamros directory inside <catkin-workspace-dir>/src
7) Run 
      $ catkin_make
   from the catkin workspace directory

Requirements
------------

- ROS
- RT-SLAM and its dependencies

Instalation Notes
-----------------

You can use robotpkg (http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/) to install
RT-SLAM and its requirements. RT-SLAM can be found inside the
"work-in-progress" directory
(http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/robotpkg-wip.html).

If you want debug symbols you should add the following lines to your
$ROBOTPKG_BASE/etc/robotpkg.conf:
   PKG_OPTIONS.jafar-kernel+= debug
   PKG_OPTIONS.jafar-rtslam+= debug
before installing rt-slam.

You can also add other optinonal packages by adding the following line
to your $ROBOTPKG_BASE/etc/robotpkg.conf: 
   PKG_OPTIONS.jafar-rtslam+= qdisplay gdhe viam MTI posterLib

To install RT-SLAM:
$] cd $ROBOTPKG_BASE/src/robotpkg/wip/jafar-rtslam/
$] make update

To install ROS and catkin follow the ROS Tutorials (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

Debug Notes
-----------

RT-SLAM has some debug flags defined internally on its header
files. To activate them, you can do the following:

$ cd $ROBOTPKG_BASE/src/robotpkg/wip/jafar-rtslam
$ make extract # Extract src code into work.<localhost>

Then find the file with the definition inside work.<localhost> and
edit to set whatever you want. Then, to recompile and install the
package, do:

$ make install

Available Nodes
---------------

  - jafardemo_node: Uses the original main.hpp file from RT-SLAM. You
                    should run it with the options defined in RT-SLAM
                    webpage.

  - rtslamros_node: Uses a modified main.hpp file, which attempts to
                    use ROS hardwares defined in this ROS package. ROS
                    hardware try to read topics only in online
                    mode. Run it with the same arguments as
                    jafardemo_node.

  - simplertslamros_node: Uses a simplified version of main.hpp. All
                          parameters should be set in simplemain.hpp
                          file before compilation. No arguments are
                          required to run.
